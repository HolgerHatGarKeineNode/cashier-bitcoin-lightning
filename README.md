## Introduction

Laravel Cashier BTCPay Server provides an expressive, fluent interface to [Bitcoin's Lightning LNbits](https://lnbits.com/) payment services. It handles almost all of the boilerplate subscription billing code you are dreading writing. In addition to basic subscription management, Cashier can handle coupons, swapping subscription, subscription "quantities", cancellation grace periods and much more.
